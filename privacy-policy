    <h1>Privacy Policy for Medipol Discount Calculator Extension</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 07/10/2024</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Medipol Discount Calculator Extension does not collect, store, or share any personal data. It is designed to work offline and perform calculations based on user input without transmitting data to external servers.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>The extension does not collect or transmit any personal information to third parties. All calculations are performed locally on the user’s device, ensuring full privacy and data security.</p>

    <h2>Google Extension Permissions</h2>
    <p>To ensure user privacy and comply with Google Chrome Web Store policies, the Medipol Discount Calculator Extension only requests permissions that are strictly necessary for its functionality. Below is an explanation of the permissions used and their status:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage:</strong> This permission was originally requested to store user preferences locally, but it is no longer necessary and has been removed.</li>
        <li><strong>ActiveTab:</strong> This permission allowed the extension to interact with the active browser tab but is no longer needed and has been removed.</li>
        <li><strong>Scripting:</strong> This permission was requested to inject scripts for potential future features, but as these features were not implemented, the permission has been removed.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The extension now only requests permissions needed for its core features, following the principle of least privilege. No permissions are requested for unused or future-proofed functionalities, ensuring compliance with Google’s Program Policies.</p>
